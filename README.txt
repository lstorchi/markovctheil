The code has been  tested and developed under Linux,  but  once 
installed  the needed  packages should work also under Mac OS X 
and Windows OS.

To run the GUI:

python markovc_qt.py 

to run the GUI you may need to export QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1

to run the CLI:

python markovc.py

Finally you'll find also a changepoint.py CLI
